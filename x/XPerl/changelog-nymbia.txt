Fixed party/player frame dragging by stats with CastParty support on
Added ability to hide party frames while in a raid group.  /perl partyinraid hide
Added option to turn off CastParty support (remember, CastParty is only active for the stat area of the party frame, so there's no need to turn castparty support off to be able to click party members normally- just click the name!)
Added option to show or hide CastParty frames
Added scaling options for individual frames
Should be no issues running on German and Korean clients.

1.1.1
Target-of-Target frame added! :D Chronos is highly recommended when using this feature.
French support added.
Random stupid bugs fixed (german shaman text, castparty init errors, some other random stuff)
Massive code cleanup and variable revamping. What this means for most people? not much yet.  Perl_UserOptions.lua is a thing of the past... currently, it's role is filled by Perl.lua, but, with this revamping comes the probability of variable saving and a graphical menu in the very near future (init is still a little pointlessly messy, it'll get cleaned up (ahem, removed) soon)

1.1.2
Option saving added.  (Major thanks to illiath, who is also working on a menu! :D)

The bad news: Distance to Target will be going away in the next patch.  Blizzard is making the function that made it possible, only work for group members.
Also, I haven't gotten around to making a Warrior alt or respeccing to Improved Scorch to fix the sunder/vulnerability code.  Soon!

1.1.6b
Fixed nil on Raid line 38

1.1.7

Should be smarter about hiding party pets
Changes made in the menu now apply automatically and instantly
Raid member health percentages now display if that member is offline

1.1.8
Ninja'd a friend's warrior and debugged sunder armor code!  Sunder armor working, let me know if fire and shadow vulnerability are as well!
Removed distance code.  Patch 1.6 makes it obsolete.
Incorperated BuffStatus code to fix some bugs and remove the dependancy ;) All raid members should show debuffs you can remove (their name turns red).  I'll be working on buffs in the near future!

1.1.9
Fixed combo points hiding
Tweaked some code to reduce lag on targeting.  Theory goes that Blizzard will be fixing said lag in the next content patch, we'll see.

1.1.9b
Fixed targeting party members / self
Fixed combo points for Druids
More improvements to targeting lag (if anyone has any problems with slow player frame updates, let me know)

1.2.0
20 buffs and 16 debuffs now show on the target
Fixed a bug with the menu and raid scaling
Fixed patch 1.7 player frame update problems
Fixed Player Portrait not showing up on login

1.2.0b
Updated toc.  /cough.

1.2.1
Preformance update.  Removed some OnUpdate functions, placed caps on those that are necessary.  Should be quicker in many situations.
Fixed a bug with setting party scale with invalid input.
Debuff stacking numbers added to target.
Altered sunder and vulnerability code. Far more efficient, and arguably pointless! Still looks cool, so I'm leaving it in. ;)

1.2.2
Minor bug fixes related to name color on the target and targettarget frames

1.2.3
Fixed lag and etc caused by default party frames showing
Fixed scale problems with the casting bar
Fixed display of dead entities (-100?  wtf?)
Updated toc to 1.9

1.2.3a
Really updated toc this time
Increased default scale settings

1.2.3b
Fixed /perl setpartyscale #.#, more robust error checking for all numeric slash commands.

1.2.4
Fixed alpha for targettarget
Fixed 1.10 frame background issues

1.2.5

Updated toc for 1.10.0 patch

1.2.5b
Fixed Perl_Party.lua nil errors

1.2.5c
Fixed Raid frame clicking issues
Implemented what I hope will be a fix for the weird errors some people are having with Perl_Player.lua:70.  These errors are not caused by my mod or the default UI, and I could never recreate them, but hopefully this will fix them.  They seem to be caused by titanpanel or something related to it (and the fact that the errors are coming up at all implies some pretty bad coding on their part)

1.2.5d
lets not talk about it.
