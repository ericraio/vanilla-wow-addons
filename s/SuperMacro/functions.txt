Functions and slash commands found in SuperMacro addon that can be helpful in your macros are listed here in alphabetical order. Alt-click on an item to insert its item link into the macro.

(For even more convenience and to shorten macros, I recommend another addon, Alias, a.k.a ASF. Read end of file for explanation.)

(P.S. I may accept requests for other convenient functions and slash commands.)

## SayRandom(...), /sayrandom, /smsayrandom
Say a random phrase from a list separated by comma. Actually, you can do more than send chat messages. There's an equal chance (1 in number of list items+1) that nothing will happen.
Ex. /sayrandom hi, hello -- says hi or hello or nothing
Ex. /script SayRandom("hi","hello"); -- same as last example
Ex. /script SayRandom("/script Print(1)","/script Print(2)"); -- actions besides chat

/script SetActionMacro( lastActionUsed, 'FindMinerals' )

Macro FindMinerals looks like this:

## Aliases to simplify macros
#
############
Aliases can simplify your macros significantly.
For example, to get current mana, alias is simply ;pm--instead of UnitMana('player'). More importantly, Alias allows values from functions into chat. Instead of:
/script SendChatMessage("Buffing you", "WHISPER", "COMMON", UnitName("target"))
use a regular chat message:
;tt Buffing you

Useful default aliases include:
;z for /script
;cn for CastSpellByName
;c for /cast
;m for /macro
;rl for /console reloadui
;pm for player mana
;pmm for player max mana
;ph for player health
;phm for player max health
;p2h for party2 health (and so on for party3, party4, party5)
