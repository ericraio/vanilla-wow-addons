Thank you for downloading this addon.

This addon provides status bar style indicators for the buffs and debuffs that are currently applied to your character.
It will also show temporary weapon buffs like eg poisons, counts for stackable debuffs or buffs with charges and the debuff borders introduced with 1.11.
Hopefully this addon will have a much smaller memory footprint than other addons of its kind by using CreateFrame in order to instaciate only as many frames as needed.

USAGE:
Install the addon as you would do with any other addon. When buffs/debuffs are shown you can move the frame by leftclicking and draging it around.
Slash commands for changing size, lock frames, ... are: /ebb or /elkbuffbar

If you find any bugs feel free to tell me about them using my author portal at http://elkano.wowinterface.com/
