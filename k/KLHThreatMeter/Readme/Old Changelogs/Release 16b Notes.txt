
Updates from R16 (i.e. 16.13):


--> The +2% threat to gloves and -2% threat to cloak enchants might be working now. Check "/ktm test threat" to see!

--> Thunderfury Proc Added. Thanks Brissa @ Argent Dawn EU.

--> Players who aren't in the raid / party will get removed from the raid table automatically. Also, people in the raid who stop reporting will have their threat reset, to stop e.g. offline people's threat getting stuck on the table.

--> Put a more general drunk filter up, and fixed the regex too.

--> Added some low priority (printout) localisations to KTM_Net.lua (in "print", "network" section).

--> Put back "/ktm gui hide" and "/ktm mastertarget" commands, also "/ktm resetraid"

--> Changed "/ktm version" commands so that players report their release and their revision numbers, e.g. "16.13" instead of just "16".

--> Righteous Fury wasn't registering from R16. Also, the talents were giving it more threat than it really helped. Fixed!

--> Fixed the Drunk / Slurred Speech detector.

--> Reduced Shield Slam's rage to 20. Also, increased threat to 250 to match research from PTR.

--> Changed Netherwind 3/8 bonus so that is is applied after other threat modifiers, to match experimental data. The mod was reporting higher than real threat before, in this case.

--> Taunt and Growl should work more often now, particularly when there is no master target defined. When they hit, if your target is targetting another player who has higher threat than you, you'll get their threat. If not, it will use the old code to determine the mob's real aggro target (which it could do in some cases when the master target was defined). Should work better on e.g. Spider Boss in ZG, also multi-mob trash pulls, at the start.

--> Added some French spell localisations. Thanks antarus.

--> GUI Stuff:

- Slightly more space for the options gui buttons for non-english languages

- The main window now shows its version, rather than "raid threat" \ "self details"
	-- Added a localisation for gui.title.text.long (should be the same for all languages)
	-- Removed gui.title.text.raid and .self

- The titles for the options gui have been reworked. 
	-- Added optionsgui.labels.titlebar.gen, .self and .raid
