-----------------
fixes from 15.18 to 15.19:


--> Added zhCN localisation

--> French localisation changes for 1.10

--> Put the files in a folder this time, woot!


[For Recent changes in R15 TEST versions, see "Development - My To Do List.txt"]

--> Did a major code edit to decrease the memory generation of the mod. This was being caused by declaring local tables in functions, which have all been removed. Passive memory generation is now 0, and should be significantly reduced in combat. The only thing that can't be stopped is 64 bytes created by every call to string.gfind(). On certain events this can happen up to 8 times, e.g. an ability being dodged / parried. But with even a large scale aoe, there shouldn't amount to more than 3 or 4 kb/sec.

--> Added localisation for French, German, Taiwanese, and Chinese Clients. It nearly killed me, but it's done. A very very big thanks to these people from Curse Gaming, in no particular order, and sorry to anyone i've left out!: CuteMiyu, Zarana, stage, erwan_oops, Kilworth, tazmanyak, Freddy, Grakamius, Selrach, Readonly.

--> 1.10 patch ready!

--> Changes to threat behaviour:
	--> added Burning Adrenaline -75% threat mod
	--> added Fetish of the Sand Reaver -70% threat mod on use
	--> added +2% threat to gloves enchant
	--> added -2% threat to back enchant
	--> Threat will not be generated while you are mind controlled
	--> Mind control shouldn't clear your threat when you go out of combat any more
	--> Added black amnesty proc
	--> Heals of the Master Target won't generate threat.

--> Added some extra documentation. In the ReadMe folder inside the KLHThreatMeter folder, have a look at
	"Warriors - Read Me!.txt" - notes for warriors using sunder in macros / mods
	"Advanced Raid Commands.txt" - guide on commands for raid leaders and officers
	"Localisation.txt" - notes on localisation
	"How You Can Help.txt" - the name just about says it all!

--> BugFixes:
	--> warlocks' master demo was adding to your threat mod, not subtracting. doh! Thanks zeak@Curse
	--> also, master demo was off by 100%.
	--> druids in cat form no longer have -20% threat. Sorry!
	--> the improved /ktm v q wasn't telling you who had older (before R13) versions
	--> corrected the next attack damage of HS rank 9. 
	--> druid swipe was causing a lua error. Thanks Boevis@Lightbringer.
	--> heroic strike rank 9: threat up to 175. Thanks Agren@? and Eldeonas@Feathermoon!


--> added the command "/ktm test states" or "/ktm t s" to check the new state variables (it's obvious).
