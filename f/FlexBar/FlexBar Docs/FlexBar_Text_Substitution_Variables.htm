<p>* Indicates limited usefulness - I used them in debugging and thought folks 
should know about them :)</p>
<p>** NOTE - also available ONLY in /echo, /print in normal macros and anywhere 
in flexmacros is: $lua expression$ - thie will be replaced with the result of 
the lua expression.&nbsp; I used this for easier debugging, but it is 
there.&nbsp; It is SO unsupported.</p>
<p>However, you can use things like:</p>
<p>/echo $FBProfileName$</p>
<p>to get "Mairelon of Silver Hand" (or whatever your name/realm is)</p>
<p>/echo $(55+99) * 2$</p>
<p>to get 308</p>
<p>for this to work it must evaluate to something, as it has "FBMacroValue=" 
prepended to it, then it is run and the contents of FBMacroValue 
output.</p>
