Decursive 1.9.7 by Archarodim

Changes from Decursive 1.9.6 FINAL to 1.9.7

*******************
====> New features:
*******************

- Now when a cast fails, only "out of sight" persons are blacklisted.

- You can hide the buttons by right clicking on "Decursive",
  when the buttons are hidden, the Decursive frame is locked so you can't move it by accident.

- Added the Option "Don't blacklist priority list names" (defaults to off)

- Added Chinese localization (zhTW)

*******************
====> Enhancements:
*******************

- Performance improve.

- Debuffs to not cure (Dreamless Sleep and Mind Vision), will not be displayed nor cured unless the unit is debuffed by other debuffs of the same kind.
  In previous versions, those debuffs were skipped only if the player was in combat.

- Decursive's frame is smaller: the version is displayed in a tooltip.

- No more risk to lose the current target when the "Check for range" option is used.

- Decursive no longer checks for mana or for the state of your curing spell, it is no longer necessary (and may avoid some freezes).

- The display of Decursive message is now more logical, the text begins to be displayed just at the bottom of the "Text Anchor" frame
  (you can move it by clicking on the 'A' in the top-right corner of the option window)

- It is now more clear to see on who Decursive is casting the curring spell.

*****************
====> Bugs fixed:
*****************

- The forgotten debug message Shamans were seeing has been removed.

- The problem priests in shadow form were experiencing has been fixed.

- No more freeze issue when a lot of players are out of range, thanks to
  Alason who gave me a new way to test for range.

- When you left-click on someone in the Decursive live-list Decursive won't try to cure your current target.

- No more 'awaiting for target state' when the cast fails.

********************
====> Small Changes:
********************

- Scanning code has been slightly optimized.

- Out of range players are no longer added to the blacklist (this was useless since Decursive is able to bypass them).

- Removed the option "check for range", Decursive will always check for range.

- The sliders in the option window have been moved to the top to avoid clicking on the last one by accident when closing the window.

- Localization files have been updated.

- French and Chinese localization files are encoded in UTF-8.

Changes from Decursive 1.9.4 to Decursive 1.9.6 Final

Important changes:

- Added an option (on by default) to play a sound when you have someone to cure (Breenild idea).
- Now when you click on a cursed person in Decursive's frame you will keep
  your current target unless you use the right-button of your mouse.
- Now Decursive is able to check if you have enough mana before casting.
- Complete French and German localization (Thanks to Archiv and WalleniuM for the German translations)
  So Decursive is able to ignore and skip correctly certain classes and debuffs in those localizations.
  This also corrects multiple dispels problem for those localizations.
- Changed the licence to GNU GPL (Decursive 1.9.4 is in public domain)

Minor changes:

- Options are reset to defaults with this version.
- Improved re-targeting.


Bugs fixed:

- Fixed initialization, 1.9.4 was sometime unable to find a spell to use.
- Mind Control dispel was impossible.
- The "check for range" option couldn't be set/unset and was causing Decursive to get stuck on out of range persons.
- Improved Event handling (faster when zoning)
- When you are in the priority list, your name is no longer displayed twice.
- the "Ignore Stealthed Units" should work as intended (it never worked before)
- Tooltip are displayed correctly.
- Other minor bug fixes.
