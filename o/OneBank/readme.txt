[b]A Couple of Notes:[/b][list]
[*]This mod does rely on the Ace2 embedable framework.  Ace2 is the next generation of the Ace line, and does not require an external Ace2 addon as a dependency.  
[*]However, OneBag is a required dependency for OneBank.  Much of the code between the two is different and as such only exists within the OneBag files.
[*]Slot highlighting will not work properly in a locale that is not currently offered.  If you want to help remedy this problem then please contact me to help aid in the last few translations.
