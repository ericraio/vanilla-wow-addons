Due to considerable delays on 1.07, I've decided to work on both 1.06.3 and 1.07 simultaneously. If you have any simple requests they'll make 1.06 updates, more complex things (eg rogue talents, eviscerate scaling, lifetap) will be in 1.07 version - whenever it comes out. ^^

Version 1.06.5
	- Changing action bar pages finally works with button text
	- Forms, Warrior stances now work correctly with button text
	- Spell Power is +30 healing in addition to spell damage now (as per 1.12 patch notes)
	- Added support for G15Bar
	- Added support for Discord Group Buttons - even mini spell book is supported
	- Fixed a Curse of Doom debuff nil error - a bunny was sacraficed to bring the infomation required =( -untested fix-
	- Added ZG Block enchant, and TC is now flooring block instead of rounding (ty bonestriker)
	- Fixed a typo on Thunder Clap
	- Ammo no longer affects melee attacks (doh!)
	- More custom bar addons will have their macro names hidden now

Version 1.06.4 (Temporary)
	- 1.07 will be out soon, and is a major rewrite - this is a temporary download.
	- Updated TOC
	- Added Bongo's Support
	- Moonfury is now applied pre gear
	- Added latest german locale (I think)
	- Fixed TC saying that GLOCK wasn't installed when it was - functionality with latest version of GLOCK untested

Version 1.06.3
	- Added Fire Festival Fury.
	- Added Very Berry Cream.
	- Added Eye of Moam.
	- Button text fixed on Flexbar.
	- Button text now works with CT Bars.
	- Button text now works with GypsyMod HotBar.
	- Consecration fixed. (Wasn't able to read in the duration)
	- Immolate fixed. (On some talent builds, DoT wouldn't be modified)

Version 1.06.2
	- Added Evocation
	- Fixed Max Dam w/ Evocation + Gem - was ~ 2000 mana out before.
	- Button Text can be disabled.
	- Fixed a bug with "Cooldown remaining: "

Version 1.06.1
	- Updated Toc to 1.11
	- Fixed mage armor (buff description has changed since 1.10)
	- Fixed an error on line 65 of Gear. (nil error)

Version 1.06
New Features:
	- New Feature: Make a macro with '/script TheoryCraftCast("Greater Heal", 1)', and it'll cast the lowest rank Greater Heal that'll bring the target to full health. Changing the 1 to 1.2 will attempt to overheal by 20% (allowing for damage whilst casting), and so forth.
	- New Hidden command: Type /tc dpsmana to add a dps/mana line to the tooltip.
	- New Hidden command: Type /tc damtodouble to add show how much +damage it'd take to double your damage on a spell (from base).
	- New Command: "/tc more" Prints all non-ui commands.
	- New Feature: *Any* macro can have its correct tooltip shown now (even ones that TC doesn't intrepret). Eg, naming a macro Ice Block(0) will show the Ice Block tooltip.
	- TC can hook in with the addon "GLOCK - Mob Resistance Calculator" for comprehensive damage stats on any target.
	- MASSIVE hit/penetration/resists rewrite, including a new option to Factor Resists in to all calculations, with edit boxes to enter School resist scores. Paints a *much* clearer picture of your gear, and gear you're testing. *Every* TC stat will change appropriately.  You'll notice in particular the worth of 1% to hit, 1% to crit and penetration increase as you target higher level enemies, and in the case of penetration it also increases as you add resists. Try 300 resist to see 10 penetration become better then 100 +damage :).
	- Button text now works with Discord Action Bars.
	- Button text now works with Nurfed Action Bars.
	- Button text now works with Flexbar, for text label substitution though I recommend Flexbar Improved.
	- Button text is now fully customizeable in position, font, colour and size.

Localisation Updates:
	- German and French locale updates.
	- Full +damage support of items that increase damage vs Undead only.
	- Elixir of frost power, and possibly other buffs, work again now. (Previously Frost was capitalised, at some patch it was changed to lowercase frost, now I read them case insensitive)

Internal Changes:
	- *MASSIVE* memory management overhaul, no regularly called TC function will require garbage collection. (Particularly noticeable for hunters - where TC had runaway memory problems due to the regular gear change event)
	- All Button Text labels are created at run time now (previously all were declared in xml file).
	- Values returned by GetSpellData are now already modified by armor.
	- Note to other developers: Spellcasts, damage til oom (remaining), damage til oom (floored) are now available from GetSpellData functions.
	- Speed improvements

Bug Fixes:
	- Paladins tooltips are neater for seals now
	- Hunters ammo is no longer affected by RWS or Barrage (autoshot damage will now read correctly)
	- Fixed outfit name (sometimes showed wrong text)
	- Fixed some things were appearing on tooltips that shouldn't have
	- DoT hybrid spells now have their dam coef displayed correctly (previously wasn't a percent, eg 0.7% instead of 70%)
	- Mana Restore is included in maxoom damage calculations once again (eg robe of the archmage).
	- Presence of Mind / Nature's Swiftness / Mind Quickening Gem / Clearcasting and other buffs that changed tooltips are no longer bugged.
