Additional Note:
----------------
	You can set some tradeprofiles depending on the customers class. 
	They can be sorted in 3 groups (sorted in order of priority)
		- All Classes
		- Class X   (e.g. Warrior)
		- Group Y 	(e.g. Melee)
	These 3 groups are ADDITIVE. if a warlock's gonna trade you, he'll get the stuff 
	you placed in all 3 groups (e.g. All Classes + Warlock + Caster)
	it would only trade the first 6 items the search-engine could find.
