------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug reports for 2.0 beta:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show attendance total as accepted+standby
Show class total as accepted+standby
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I create a new event and enter a custom event name, even though I have my
'attend' checkbox off, GC will sign me up as attending and I need to edit my
attendance. If I create a new event without entering a custom event name (ie
the addon automatically remmebers one), it will not 'attend' me if the checkbox
is off.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.0b17 Changes:

- Fixed bug causing case sensitivity in channel names
- Fixed bug causing update requests to be lost during the five minute timeout
  period after login
  
v2.0b16 Changes:

- Fixed another bug in processing request queues

v2.0b15 Changes:

- Updated TOC for patch 1.10
- Turned off debug code

v2.0b14 Changes:

- Fixed bug with processing request queues which could cause large backups
  of requests and sporadic freezes lasting from less than a second to 30
  seconds or more.  The frequency and severity of this problem is related
  to the number of users on the network and therefore primarily affected
  larger guilds.

v2.0b13 Changes:

- Fixed typo causing nil pointer error in EventDatabase.lua

v2.0b12 Changes

- Fixed bug causing event IDs to become strings which resulted in events not being
  located properly for attendance processing
- Fixed bug causing RSVPs to stay around after the event or database they're for
  are deleted

v2.0b11 Changes

- Fixed player attendance comment to unescape special characters
- Fixed minor race condition which could cause initialization to
  halt when data channel is already joined

  requests from the queue

  response and then immediately changing to the opposite response
- Improved event/attendance processing performance when the calendar UI
  isn't open

v2.0b10 Changes

- Delayed initial event update requests until after the guild roster is received
  when trust setting is Guild Members.  This should prevent problems with unreliable
  event delivery when using that trust setting.

v2.0b9 Changes

- Modified event viewer to disable comment field with neither Yes nor No are checked
- Fixed recognition of tradeskill events and tradeskill window opening so that cooldowns
  are properly scheduled
- Added timeout to calendar updates to prevent a disconnected player from causing
  updates to becomed locked out
- Disabled Invite button when player isn't capable of inviting
- Modified event viewer so that comment-only attendance feedback isn't sent
- Modified roster updating do refresh every four minutes so that rank-based authentication
  is more reliable

v2.0b8 Changes

- Fixed Ahn'Qiraj Ruins reset event detection
- Fixed processing of RSVPs so that comment updates don't cause the player to lose
  their date/time priority or accepted/standby status
- Fixed invites so that they aren't limited by the event attendance settings but are
  limited by the number of players selected
- Added Salt Shaker and SnowMaster 9000 support for tradeskill cooldown events
- Removed filtering of whispers before an event is opened.  This was causing too much
  trouble with missing invite requests when the organizer hadn't opened the event yet.

v2.0b7 Changes

- Fixed bug which caused a players rank to fail to update in the group list after updating
  the rank in the attendance list

v2.0b5 Changes

- Fixed sorting of events when events are on different days in server date/time but
  on the same date in local date/time
- Fixed Rebuild Database so that private events (tradeskill cooldowns and instance
  resets) aren't added to the public calendar
- Fixed bugs in filtering whispers from existing event attendees/party members
- Fixed bug which caused Enable Automatic Confirmations checkbox to revert to its
  original setting whenever attendance for an event was updated
- Prefixed automatic event invite whispers with [GroupCalendar]
- Modified group invites to do them at a slower rate so that Blizzard's spammer
  detection sentry's don't mistakenly kick the event organizer offline
- Fixed event viewer so that attendees don't send a request to delete themselves
  from an event when they're on the Standby list

v2.0b4 Changes

- Fixed event editing in local time zone for events where local date
  is different from server date

  attendees and party members

- Added Clear button to Recent Whispers category
- Fixed attendance menu items so they work correctly without Outfitter installed

v2.0b2 Changes

- Updated user's manual for 2.0 features
- Fixed nil pointer bug when handling alts list in attendance responses
- Fixed bug causing request queue to be processed much more slowly than
  intended.  This was especially noticeable at startup because channel
  initialization was delayed for a very long time.
- Fixed bug causing attendance responses not to be requested at startup if
  trust is set to guild members only
- Modifed protocol to suppress sending updates for three minutes after login
- Added task queue for managing tasks which should run independently of
  channel traffic

- Fixed group expand/collapse

v2.0a3 Changes

- Fixed group invite

v2.0a2 Changes

- Fixed time wrapping so that events which cross over midnight display the correct end time

v1.2.1 Changes

- Changed server time zone calculation to correct for players more than 12 hours off from the server

v1.2b4 Changes

- Added "circled" dates and times for events being attended
- Fixed bug causing attendance feedback to get reset sometimes while trying to change it
- Modified to hide the "use server time" checkbox when server and local time are the same

v1.2b3 Changes

- Today and Date buttons now toggle the summary window
- Hooked up guild rank caches to improve performance
- Modified database trust checking to be a scheduled event instead of
  immediate in order to improve performance
- Modified queues to be processed more steadily in an attempt to reduce
  unnecessary traffic and smooth out potential lag spikes

v1.2b2 Changes

- Modified database code to use an "LocalUsers" tag.  A character will not use
  a database until he sees it offered on his own network.  This should prevent
  unguilded toons from clearing the database cache as well as preventing toons
  in other guilds from spreading events between the guilds.
  
v1.2b1 Changes

- Added event cleanup so that events older than 45 days are automatically
  removed, except for birthdays which are rescheduled for the same time next year
- Added ability to display and edit events in local date and time instead
  of server date and time

v1.1 Changes

- Changed dungeon order to be by level instead of by English alphabetical
  order
- Added Simplified and Traditional Chinese translations
- Fixed bug with Trust tab names not working correctly for names that
  didn't start with a Roman letter
- Fixed crash when switching to windowed mode on Macintosh clients
- Fixed minor layout bugs

v1.1b23 Changes

- Fixed nil pointer bug when reconstructing databases from their
  change history

v1.1b22 Changes

- Fixed nil pointer problem whene executing attendance changelists
- Fixed bug which caused events which don't have a type to not be
  added correctly to other people's calendars
- Added icon for events which don't have an event type
- Changed calendar button to use the GameTimeFrame as a parent so that it hides
  or moves if a UI changes the time frame
- Fixed store auto config so that the config data isn't cleared accidentally
  if an officer uses manual config but doesn't select a config player

v1.1b21 Changes

- Added Battlegrounds events (I know, I shouldn't be adding features
  this late but this really belonged in 1.0 with the other dungeons
  and it was only omitted because of my light battlegrounds experience)
- Modified calendar icon rendering to avoid icons for events it doesn't
  understand.  This will allow new event types to be added in the future
  without causing the calendar to render ugly green squares.

v1.1b20 Changes

- Added support for key binding to show/hide the calendar.  This was a trivial
  change which should make life a little easier for people using heavily
  customized UIs.
- Updated BFD icon with new artwork
- Changed database ID to be a timestamp instead of a sequence number.  This fixes
  Rebuild Database so that you only have to hit it once to make it clear up the
  network and also fixes initialization so that throwing away your settings file
  will clear your old database from the network.
- Modified update handling so that changes are only made after the update is
  received.  This fixes problems with partial updates being sent out on the
  network while they were still in progress as well as fixing problems caused
  by updates being promised but never arriving.

v1.1b19 Changes

- Fixed bug causing guild trust level to be calculated incorrectly

v1.1b18 Changes

- Increased startup delay to 2 minutes but added code which shortens it
  to 10 seconds when the General channel is joined.  This should make
  startup quick for people who don't experience significant login lag
  but still be long enough to ensure that /1 doesn't go to the calendar
  channel if there is a lot of lag
- Fixed bug causing attendance requests to be ignored by the event owner
  under some circumstances
- Fixed excess traffic when requesting authoritative updates
- Fixed live updating of UI when new event data arrives
- Modified trust UI to hide rank dropdown when trust group isn't set to guild
- Modified trust UI to update when autoconfig data arrives
- Fixed change notification on deleted events

v1.1b17 Changes

  as "Pending approval"
- Changed minimap icon to be smaller, more discrete so that the sun and
  moon could shine through
- Changed calendar icon to be more in the spirit of the game's design
- Fixed bug in auto-config trust level.  This may be responsible for
  events not showing up or attendance requests not getting confirmed.
- Fixed local time calculation when server time is near midnight
- Updated Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj icon

v1.1b16 Changes

- Increased delay until channel initialization after login
- Added more status messages during initialization

v1.1b15 Changes

- Changed channel initialization to provide detailed error information when
  the password fails or the number of allowed channels is exceeded

v1.1b14 Changes

- Fixed local time calculation so it occurs on PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event
  instead of VARIABLES_LOADED.  The server time value doesn't appear to be
  reliable at VARIABLES_LOADED time.
- Restored the old Dire Maul event icon
- Lowered the saturation of BRD, MC and RFC icons for better appearance
- Modified RebuildDatabase to repair event IDs if there are any collisions
- Fixed bug causing changes to be lost during update event processing.  This
  was causing events to disappear right after they were created but could
  also cause other problems such as attendees disappearing or changes to
  events reverting to the original event values.
- Added support for separate update request for owner revision and shared revision

v1.1b13 Changes

- Fixed bug which caused drunken chat strings to be escaped in a different
  format than they were being un-escaped, causing damaged messages.  I 
  really shouldn't program at 2am, really.

v1.1b12 Changes

- Updated Onyxia icon with new artwork
- Added check for invalid packet on UPD (DB or RAT) message
- Added support for intoxicated players
- Changed protocol to GC2 since it isn't compatible with the drunk escaping

- Fixed bug causing nil pointer error during certain updates
- Added attendance total to attendance panel

v1.1b8 Changes

  databases to clear any corruption problems

- Changed initialization sequencing to avoid excessive loading of the
  guild roster
- Added guild roster cache to speed up trust lookup
- Fixed bug causing attendance items to show highlights where there was
  nothing to highlight
- Attendance list names are now concatenated with their level and class
  name to conserve space

v1.1b1 Changes

- Attendance feedback comments are now displayed as a tooltip in the
  Attendance panel
- Added a new Today button in the main calendar display to jump directly
  to the current date

  and feedback comments so they can be properly transmitted
